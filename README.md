# swaywm-packages-slackware
No warranty of any kind is given or implied that these packages will work as intended, or even not damage your system.  
wlroots should be built/installed first, scdoc second, swaywm third, swaybg & dmenu-wayland last. scdoc is a build only dependency and can be removed once the rest is built.
These are 1.5.1 packages & the slackbuilds are messy. The 1.6 packages are in the other repo and slackbuilds are cleaned up.
